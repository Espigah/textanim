Extra tools for special treatment of TextAnim instance. 
Can convert the blocks to bitmap, apply patterns, etc.

=Examples=

===toBitmap===
Converts each block of a TextAnim to bitmap, smoothed or not:
{{{
var txtanim:TextAnim = new TextAnim(myTextField);
TextAnimTools.toBitmap(txtanim, true);
txtanim.breakMode = TextAnim.BREAK_IN_LINES;
txtanim.effects = jump;
txtanim.start();
}}}


===setPattern===
Applies an image (movieclip, bitmap, etc.) as texture. This sample spent more than a function like effect, you can pass an array with as many effects as you want.
{{{
var txtanim:TextAnim = new TextAnim(myTextField);
TextAnimTools.setPattern(txtanim, new MyPattern());
anim.animMode = TextAnim.ANIM_TO_EDGES;
txtanim.effects = [alphaIn, scaleIn];
txtanim.interval = 200;
txtanim.start();
}}}

===setGradientLinear===
Prints in text a linear gradient with many colors as you want. This example is experiencing a delay to start the animation in the start method. And multiple effects.
{{{
var txtanim:TextAnim = new TextAnim(myTextField);
TextAnimTools.setGradientLinear(txtanim, [0x000000, 0xFF0000], 180);
txtanim.effects = [myEffect, otherEffect];
txtanim.start(2000);
}}}
